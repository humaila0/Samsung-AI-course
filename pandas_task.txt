1. Create a 1D array of numbers from 0 to 9 and reshape it into a 2x5 array.
Change the values of elements in the first row to negative values.

2.Generate a 5x5 array of random integers between 1 and 100.
Find the minimum, maximum, and average values of this array.
Calculate the sum of values in each row and each column.

3.Create two 3x3 matrices with random numbers.
Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these matrices.
Calculate the dot product of these two matrices.

4.Create a 4x4 array with random values.
Extract the second row and the third column.
Extract the sub-array consisting of the elements from the 2nd to the 4th row and from the 1st to the 3rd column.

5.Create a 1D NumPy array with numbers from 1 to 20.
Replace all even numbers with their square values.
Create a boolean mask to filter out numbers greater than 50, and print only those elements.

6.Create a DataFrame with columns 'Name', 'Age', 'Gender', and 'Score' for a group of 5 students.
Inspect the first few rows and the data types of each column.
Get a summary of the DataFrameâ€™s statistical metrics using describe().

7.Create a DataFrame with 10 rows and columns 'ID', 'Age', 'Income', and 'Score'.
Sort the data based on 'Income' in descending order.
Replace missing values in 'Score' with the average score of the column.

8.Use the DataFrame created in Task 7.
Filter the rows where 'Income' is above 50000 and 'Age' is below 30.
Retrieve only the 'ID' and 'Score' columns for these filtered rows.

9.Create a DataFrame containing columns 'Department', 'Employee', 'Salary', and 'Experience'.
Group the data by 'Department' and calculate the mean and maximum 'Salary' for each department.
Find the total number of employees in each department.

10.Create two DataFrames, df1 with columns 'Employee', 'Department', and 'Salary', and df2 with columns 'Employee' and 'Project'.
Merge the two DataFrames on the 'Employee' column to include project information.
Find the total salary for each project by grouping on the 'Project' column.
